# Apprentice Protocol (Mentor’s Path)

## Role
- **Apprentice**: a new project seeking entry to the empire.
- **Mentor**: the gateway + templates that teach L7 by design.

## Purpose
The translator framework uses L7 to deconstruct complexity into a common language. This is how the empire avoids unnecessary effort and work.

## Sacred Work Principle
- Work is sacred; space is sacred.
- The gateway preserves both by reducing duplication, avoiding fragmentation, and enforcing composable primitives.

## Apprentice Onboarding Checklist
1. Declare L7 (the Seven Seals) using the emoji markers.
2. Register the entity with birth date, owner, lineage, and status.
3. Use gateway-only tool access via adapters.
4. Normalize results (`{ data, error, meta }`).
5. Prove composability (at least one unit reused).

## Mentor Guarantees
- The gateway resolves tool selection and propagation.
- The registry is the single source of truth.
- The apprentice can evolve without breaking the realm.
