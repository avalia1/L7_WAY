# The Transformer (Mentor Engine)

## Purpose
The Transformer applies the Book of the Law to an Apprentice project and converts it into a compliant L7 citizen.

## Inputs
- Project intent and scope
- Owner and lineage
- Required capabilities

## Outputs
- L7 declaration (Seven Seals)
- Entity registry entry (birth, owner, status)
- Adapter boundary plan (what tools are called)

## Process
1. **Translate** intent into L7 dimensions.
2. **Register** entity with birth date, owner, lineage.
3. **Constrain** with law (gateway-only, adapters, normalized results).
4. **Compose** into citizens and, if needed, legions.

## Result
The apprentice becomes a citizen with agency: legible, governed, and composable.
