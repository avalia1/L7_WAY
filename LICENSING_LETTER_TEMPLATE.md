RE: Commercial Use of L7 WAY Software — Licensing Notice

Dear [Name],

I am writing to you as the sole creator and copyright holder of the L7 WAY
software system, doing business as AVLI Cloud LLC.

## Identification of Use

It has come to my attention that [Company Name] is using L7 components in
a commercial capacity, specifically:

- [Component 1 identified]
- [Component 2 identified]
- [Description of how L7 tools are integrated into their operations]

## License Terms

The L7 WAY software is available under the following terms:

- **Non-commercial use**: Free, always, no fee, universal access.
- **Commercial use**: One-time licensing fee, as described below.

## Fee Calculation

The one-time licensing fee is 10% of profit attributable to L7 components,
calculated proportionally:

```
Fee = 10% x Profit x L7 Usage Proportion
```

Where "L7 Usage Proportion" is the fraction of your profit-generating
operations that depend on L7 tools. This proportion is determined in good
faith by mutual agreement.

For example:
- If L7 tools are central to your entire operation (100%): 10% of profit.
- If L7 tools support 25% of your operations: 10% x 25% = 2.5% of profit.
- If L7 tools are a minor component (5%): 10% x 5% = 0.5% of profit.

## What You Receive

Upon payment of the one-time fee:

1. A perpetual, irrevocable commercial license to use, modify, and deploy
   all L7 tools indefinitely.
2. No recurring fees, no per-seat charges, no renewal required.
3. No monitoring or audits after payment.
4. No future claims under this license — the matter is permanently closed.
5. Full freedom to use the tools as you see fit.

## Timeline

I respectfully request that you:

1. Acknowledge receipt of this letter within **30 days**.
2. Enter into good-faith negotiation of the L7 Usage Proportion.
3. Execute a written licensing agreement within **90 days** of first contact.

Extensions are granted upon request in good faith.
