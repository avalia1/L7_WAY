L7 WAY — SOFTWARE LICENSE

Copyright (c) 2026 Alberto Valido Delgado, doing business as AVLI Cloud LLC.
All rights reserved.


1. OWNERSHIP

The L7 system — including its 7-dimensional Common Lingua, Gateway architecture,
Universal OS translations, tool schemas, flow engine, MCP server implementations,
web interfaces, adapters, registry, correspondence tables, and all constituent
source code, documentation, and design — is the exclusive intellectual property
of Alberto Valido Delgado ("The Founder"), sole architect and originator.


2. NON-COMMERCIAL USE

Free. Always. Universal access.

Any individual, researcher, educator, student, or organization may use, copy,
modify, and distribute the L7 system for any non-commercial purpose, free of
charge, provided that this license notice and attribution to the Founder are
included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

No fee. No registration. No approval required.


3. COMMERCIAL USE

Any entity that derives commercial profit from the L7 system or any of its
components shall pay a one-time licensing fee to the Founder.

   a. FEE: 10% (ten percent) of profit attributable to L7 components,
      calculated proportionally:

      Fee = 10% x Profit x L7 Usage Proportion

      Where "L7 Usage Proportion" is the fraction of the enterprise's
      profit-generating operations that depend on L7 tools.

      Examples:
      - If 100% of business is conducted using L7 tools: 10% of all profit.
      - If L7 tools are used in 10% of profit-producing operations:
        10% of 10% of profit (i.e., 1% of total profit).
      - If L7 tools are used in 50% of operations: 10% of 50% = 5% of
        total profit.

      The proportion is determined in good faith by mutual agreement
      between the licensee and AVLI Cloud LLC at the time of licensing.

   b. ONE-TIME: This fee is paid once. Upon payment, the licensee receives
      a perpetual, irrevocable commercial license to use, modify, and deploy
      L7 tools indefinitely. No recurring fees. No per-seat charges.
      No renewal. No audits after payment.

   c. PROCESS: Contact AVLI Cloud LLC to establish a written licensing
      agreement. Good-faith negotiation. Written agreement executed.
      Payment remitted. License granted. Done.

   d. DERIVATIVE WORKS: Any software, service, product, or system that
      incorporates, extends, or is substantially based on L7 architecture,
      schemas, or code is a derivative work and subject to this license.


4. POST-PAYMENT RIGHTS

Once the one-time fee is paid:

   a. Perpetual license to use all L7 tools commercially.
   b. No future litigation under this license — the matter is closed.
   c. No recurring fees — one payment, forever.
   d. No monitoring or audits.
   e. Freedom to use, modify, and deploy as the licensee sees fit.


5. THE FOUNDER'S ROLE

The Founder creates tools. The Founder collects the one-time licensing fee
for commercial use. The Founder does not monitor, enforce, judge, or restrict
how the tools are used after licensing.

How the tools are used is the licensee's decision and responsibility. Existing
laws in all applicable jurisdictions govern the conduct of all parties.


6. FOUNDER'S RIGHT

The Founder retains perpetual, irrevocable, unrestricted, and free access to
every tool, component, and derivative work created by, through, or under the
L7 system. This right cannot be overridden, sublicensed away, or extinguished
by any contract, agreement, acquisition, merger, or transfer of ownership.


7. RESTRICTIONS

   a. No entity may claim ownership of L7 or its derivatives without written
      consent from the Founder.
   b. No entity may sublicense L7 rights to third parties without written
      consent from the Founder.
   c. No entity may remove, alter, or obscure this license or the Founder's
      attribution from any distribution.
   d. The L7 name and terminology are the exclusive property of the Founder.


8. SUCCESSION AND CONTINUITY

This license and all rights, obligations, and terms herein shall survive the
death, incapacity, or unavailability of the Founder. Upon such event:

   a. All intellectual property rights transfer to the successor entity
      designated in the AVLI Cloud LLC Operating Agreement and/or the
      Founder's revocable living trust.
   b. The licensing terms remain unchanged. The one-time fee structure,
      the non-commercial freedom, and the post-payment perpetual license
      continue in full force.
   c. The proof of authorship (git history, salt seals, original artifacts)
      exists independently and speaks for itself regardless of the
      Founder's availability.
   d. No party may use the Founder's death, incapacity, or unavailability
      as grounds to claim the IP is abandoned, orphaned, or in the public
      domain. The copyright endures for the Founder's life plus 70 years
      per 17 USC § 302.
   e. Successor trustees or members shall continue licensing operations
      under these same terms, guided by the principle that all purpose of
      this work is to serve the greatest good of humanity.


9. LAWFUL USE

This license is granted to parties operating within the law. The Founder
does not monitor, investigate, or enforce how tools are used. However:

   a. If a licensee's use of L7 tools is found by a court of competent
      jurisdiction to be connected with criminal activity, the license
      granted herein is not a defense to criminal liability. The license
      governs commercial use of software; it does not authorize, condone,
      or protect unlawful conduct.
   b. The Founder's licensing fee (Section 3) applies equally to all
      commercial users regardless of the nature of their business.
      The fee is for the use of the tools, not an endorsement of the
      user's conduct.
   c. Criminal matters are governed by the applicable criminal law of
      the relevant jurisdiction. The Founder has no role in criminal
      enforcement and makes no representations about any user's conduct.


10. PATENT RESERVATION

The Founder reserves all rights to seek patent protection for the L7
architecture, including but not limited to:
   - The 7-dimensional tool declaration system (Common Lingua)
   - The universal spatial computing translation layer (Universal OS)
   - The cross-platform correspondence table methodology (777)
   - The gateway-first tool orchestration pattern
   - The flow-based cross-device orchestration engine


11. NO WARRANTY

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED. THE FOUNDER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER
LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE.


12. GOVERNING LAW

This license shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, United
States of America. Any disputes arising under this license shall be resolved
in the courts of Broward County, Florida, or the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Florida.


13. PRIOR VERSIONS

Any prior license references (including MIT license references in package
metadata or earlier distributions) applied to the versions in which they
appeared. This license governs the current version and all future versions
of the L7 system. Recipients of prior versions retain the rights granted
under the license terms that accompanied those versions.
