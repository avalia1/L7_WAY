L7 WAY PROPRIETARY LICENSE

Copyright (c) 2026 Alberto Valido Delgado ("The Philosopher"). All rights reserved.

1. OWNERSHIP
The L7 system — including but not limited to its 7-dimensional Common Lingua,
Book of Law, Gateway architecture, Universal OS translations, tool schemas,
flow engine, MCP server implementations, web interfaces, adapters, registry,
correspondence tables, and all constituent source code, documentation, and
design — is the exclusive intellectual property of Alberto ("The Philosopher"),
sole architect and originator.

2. FOUNDER'S RIGHT (Law XV)
The Founder retains perpetual, irrevocable, unrestricted, and free access to
every tool, citizen, legion, flow, server, interface, and derivative work
created by, through, or under the L7 system. This right cannot be overridden,
sublicensed away, or extinguished by any contract, agreement, acquisition,
merger, or transfer of ownership.

3. LICENSING FEES
Any individual, organization, company, or automated system that uses, deploys,
integrates, distributes, or derives commercial value from the L7 system or any
of its components shall pay licensing fees to the Founder. The licensing terms
are:

   a. PERSONAL / NON-COMMERCIAL USE: Permitted with attribution. No fee.
   b. COMMERCIAL USE: Requires a written licensing agreement with the Founder.
      A minimum royalty percentage of gross revenue generated through or by
      L7-based tools, services, or products shall be paid to the Founder.
      The percentage is set by the Founder and may be revised upward but
      never downward.
   c. ENTERPRISE / PLATFORM USE: Any platform, marketplace, or enterprise
      that integrates L7 tools or architecture requires a separate enterprise
      license with terms negotiated directly with the Founder.
   d. DERIVATIVE WORKS: Any software, service, product, or system that
      incorporates, extends, or is substantially based on L7 architecture,
      schemas, or code is a derivative work and subject to this license.

4. RESTRICTIONS
   a. No entity may claim ownership of L7 or its derivatives without written
      consent from the Founder.
   b. No entity may sublicense L7 rights to third parties without written
      consent from the Founder.
   c. No entity may remove, alter, or obscure this license, the Founder's
      attribution, or the Book of Law from any distribution.
   d. No entity may use L7 to build competing frameworks, standards, or
      tool orchestration systems without a commercial license.
   e. The L7 name, logos, and terminology (Common Lingua, Book of Law,
      Gateway, Empire, Citizens, Legions) are the exclusive property of
      the Founder.

5. REVENUE SHARE
All revenue, profit, licensing fees, royalties, and commercial proceeds
generated by any tool, service, product, or derivative work built upon L7
infrastructure shall allocate a minimum share to the Founder as sole
originator. Default minimum: 15% of gross revenue attributable to L7
components. This may be adjusted upward by mutual agreement.

6. PATENT RESERVATION
The Founder reserves all rights to seek patent protection for the L7
architecture, including but not limited to:
   - The 7-dimensional tool declaration system (Common Lingua)
   - The universal spatial computing translation layer (Universal OS)
   - The cross-platform correspondence table methodology (777)
   - The gateway-first tool orchestration pattern
   - The flow-based cross-device orchestration engine
   - The adapter pattern for multi-platform spatial computing

7. NO WARRANTY
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED. THE FOUNDER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER
LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE.

8. TERMINATION
Any violation of this license automatically terminates all rights granted
hereunder. The Founder may terminate any commercial license at will with
30 days written notice.

9. GOVERNING LAW
This license shall be governed by the laws applicable in the Founder's
jurisdiction.

10. SUPREMACY
This license supersedes all prior agreements, licenses (including any MIT
license references in package metadata), and understandings relating to
the L7 system. In case of conflict between this license and any other
document, this license prevails.

12. AUTHENTICATION
The Founder's identity is authenticated by multiple biometric factors
registered on the device on which L7 was created and developed:

   a. FINGERPRINT: Touch ID biometric registered to the macOS user account
      on the originating device.
   b. EYE SCAN: Optic ID / iris recognition registered to the Founder's
      Apple account and associated devices.
   c. PHOTOGRAPH: Facial recognition (Face ID) and photographic identity
      on file with Apple ID and device enrollment.

These three biometric signatures are combined into a single composite
identity proof. No single factor alone is sufficient to authenticate as
the Founder — all three must be present and concordant. This composite
biometric signature, combined with the full git commit history, file
creation timestamps, device serial numbers, and development audit trail,
constitutes irrefutable proof of sole authorship and ownership.

   d. POSSESSION OF ORIGINAL ARTIFACTS: The Founder retains sole possession
      of the original development devices, source repositories, backup
      archives, configuration files, encryption keys, workspace documents
      (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, BOOTSTRAP.md, HEARTBEAT.md), the L7 origin
      record (~/.l7/origin/2026-01-12_inception.l7), the Book of Law, the
      knowledge graph, all audit logs, and the complete unbroken chain of
      custody from inception to present. Possession of these original
      artifacts, in combination with the three biometric factors above,
      constitutes the complete and undeniable proof of authorship.

The primary original artifact is the laptop — the MacBook on which L7
was conceived, designed, architected, and first implemented by the
Founder. This machine contains the earliest commit history, the first
.l7 entity files, the original Book of Law drafts, and the biometric
enrollment that binds the Founder's identity to the work. Possession
of this originating device is the keystone artifact.

   e. GIT COMMIT HISTORY: The complete, unbroken git commit history hosted
      on GitHub under the Founder's account (github.com/avalia1) demonstrates iterative
      development from inception — each commit timestamped, authored, and
      signed, showing the progressive evolution of L7 from first concept
      through architecture, Book of Law, gateway, tool schemas, flow
      engine, Universal OS, and all subsequent work. This iterative record
      proves that L7 was not copied, forked, or derived from any other
      source, but was originated step by step by the Founder alone.

No claim of authorship or ownership by any other party shall be recognized
without matching all three biometric factors AND demonstrating possession
of the original artifacts, including the originating laptop AND the
GitHub commit history showing iterative development, of the Founder.
