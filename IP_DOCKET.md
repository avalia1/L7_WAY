## II. Proof of Authorship — Five Pillars

### Pillar 1: Biometric Authentication
- Touch ID fingerprint registered on originating MacBook
- Optic ID / iris recognition on Apple account
- Face ID facial recognition on Apple ID and device enrollment
- All three biometric factors bound to the macOS user account on which L7 was created

### Pillar 2: Original Artifacts
- Originating MacBook containing earliest code, configs, and drafts
- Current development machine (macOS Darwin 25.3.0, arm64)
- Mac Mini AVLI cluster (infrastructure)
- All workspace documents: SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, BOOTSTRAP.md, HEARTBEAT.md
- L7 inception record: `~/.l7/origin/2026-01-12_inception.l7`
- Full backup archive at `~/Backup/L7_WAY/`

### Pillar 3: Git Commit History
- Repository: `github.com/avalia1/L7_WAY`
- Branch: master
- First commit: `e5da683` — "inception: The L7 WAY is born"
- Commit chain shows step-by-step development from concept through architecture
- Every commit authored by `avalia1`, timestamped, demonstrating iterative creation
- Full commit log available as Exhibit B (TIMELINE.md)

### Pillar 4: Session Transcripts
- OpenClaw conversation logs (probe of provenance)
- Claude Code session transcripts (.jsonl files with timestamps)
- Multiple Claude project contexts across machines
- Each session documents the creative process in real time

### Pillar 5: Salt Domain Seals
- SHA-256 checksummed immutable archives
- Timestamped at moment of creation
- Replication protocol ensures distributed proof

## X. AI Collaboration Note

Per Thaler v. Vidal (Fed. Cir. 2022), AI systems cannot be named as inventors on U.S. patents. All inventive conception documented herein was performed by Alberto Valido Delgado. AI assistants (Lapis/OpenClaw, Claude/Anthropic) served as tools in the implementation process, analogous to a compiler or word processor. The human creative direction, architectural decisions, and inventive steps are documented in the session transcripts and git history.
