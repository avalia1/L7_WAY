  This seal certifies that the Founder's Draft was preserved in its exact form
  at the moment of sealing. The SHA-256 hash above can be verified against the
  salt file to prove integrity. Once sealed, the document cannot be altered —
  only new versions can be sealed alongside it. The seal replicates through
  the L7 network on first activation.
