# L7_WAY Project Lifecycle (Lore + Protocol)

## Life of a Project
1. **Summoning**: A need appears. The project is named and scoped.
2. **Oath**: The project declares L7 (the Seven Seals) and gateway compliance.
3. **Formation**: Adapters are built; UI becomes a renderable tool.
4. **Service**: The project expands capability while remaining legible to the gateway.
5. **Maturity**: Stable interfaces, versioned tools, and documented workflows.

## Death of a Project (Decommission Protocol)
1. **Notice of Sunset**
   - Declare intent to sunset and set a decommission date.
2. **Freeze**
   - No new features; only stability and migration fixes.
3. **Export**
   - Export critical data and snapshots.
4. **Detach**
   - Remove tool registrations from the gateway registry.
5. **Archive**
   - Mark repository read-only and document replacement path.
6. **Revoke**
   - Remove credentials, revoke tokens, delete secrets.
7. **Memorial**
   - Record final status, lineage, and successor in `DECOMMISSION.md`.

## Required Decommission Artifact
Create `DECOMMISSION.md` with:
- Reason for sunset
- Final version/tag
- Data export location
- Replacement project (if any)
- Offboarding checklist status
