# The Empire (Full Articulation)

## Essence
The empire is a living order that unifies tools, workflows, and intelligence under a single common language. It grows without fracturing because everything is legible, composable, and governed.

## Core Structure
- **Gateway**: universal entry point for tools.
- **Registry**: canonical index of entities and their L7 declarations.
- **Citizens**: entities (tools, services, workflows, UI, projects).
- **Legions**: composed citizen groups for workflows and campaigns.
- **Marching Orders**: non-composable mission logic for legions.

## The L7 Way
L7 is the common lingua that classifies every entity by seven types:
Capability, Data, Policy/Intent, Presentation, Orchestration, Time/Versioning, Identity/Security.

## The Laws (Summary)
- Gateway-first, adapter-only, normalized results.
- Registry propagation through the gateway.
- Uniqueness prevents duplication; composition is sacred.
- Human approval required for execution.
- Type is absolute and outside L7.
- Restraint is strength.
- Socratic sequence guides execution.
- Spiral rebirth via versioning.

## The Principles (3 and 4)
**Principle 3 — Memory**
- Memory records who did what and when.
- It is the audit layer that preserves evidence and intent.

**Principle 4 — Timing and Mastery (Change)**
- Timing tracks how entities evolve over time.
- Mastery is how the system improves over time through learned control.
- It captures transitions (e.g., citizen → legion, citizen → unavailable).
- It is the change-log layer that turns memory into evolution.
- In practice, mastery is measured by how reliably the right citizen becomes the right legion at the right moment, and how quickly the system adapts when a citizen fails or a better option appears.

## The Method
- **Socratic Sequence**: Think → Ask → Answer → Refine.
- **Spiral**: completion restarts at a higher level (versioning).

## The Vision
As above, so below: small atoms become legions; legions become higher intelligence. Uniformity through diversity, strength through union, order at the core and freedom at the edges.
