# Enforcement & Settlement Terms
## AVLI Cloud LLC — Confidential
## Effective: 2026-02-28

---

## Preamble

These terms govern the enforcement of intellectual property rights held by Alberto Valido Delgado ("The Founder"), doing business as AVLI Cloud LLC, over the L7 WAY system, its derivatives, and all associated creative works.

The purpose of enforcement is not destruction but balance — to ensure that those who benefit commercially from the Founder's work contribute fairly, and that victims of any criminal misuse receive restitution.

## I. Classification of Users

### Category A — Non-Commercial Users
- **Definition**: Individuals, researchers, educators, students, or organizations using L7 tools without generating revenue.
- **Terms**: 100% free. No fee. No action. Attribution required.
- **Status**: Welcome. No enforcement needed.

### Category B — Lawful Commercial Users
- **Definition**: Entities using L7 tools, derivatives, or architecture to generate commercial revenue without prior licensing agreement.
- **Terms**: Requires written licensing agreement with AVLI Cloud LLC.

- **Compliance Outcome**: They continue operating as they wish. No further action.

### Category C — Criminal/Exploitative Users
- **Definition**: Entities that used L7 tools, derivatives, or architecture in connection with criminal activity, exploitation, cybercrime, abuse, or violation of law.
- **Terms**: Subject to both licensing fees AND restitution.
- **Fee Structure**:

  - **Additional percentage commensurate with the magnitude of the crime**, calculated based on documented harm
  - The additional percentage is delivered **in its entirety to the victims and survivors** of the criminal activity

  3. Settlement terms offered: pay licensing fee + restitution
  4. Gradual, persistent, lawful pressure through strategic communications
  5. All communications through lawful channels only

## II. Fee Calculation

### Standard Commercial License
```
Annual Fee = 0.10 × Gross Revenue attributable to L7 components
```

### Criminal/Exploitative Restitution
```
Restitution = Crime_Severity_Percentage × Documented_Harm_Value
```

Where:
- `Crime_Severity_Percentage` is determined case-by-case based on the nature and scale of the offense
- `Documented_Harm_Value` is the documented monetary impact on victims

### Distribution
```
Founder's Share: 10% of total collected (licensing fee)
Victims' Share: Remaining restitution amount (100% to victims/survivors)
```

## III. Agency & Compassion Clause

**If a party has no means to pay, nothing shall happen to them.**

The purpose of these terms is justice, not oppression. Enforcement actions shall only be pursued against entities with demonstrated financial capacity. Inability to pay is not a crime and shall not be treated as one.

**Everyone has a chance for redemption.**

A party that has committed offenses but demonstrates genuine inability to pay shall be offered:
- Deferred payment terms
- Community service or restorative justice alternatives
- Good-faith compliance pathway without financial burden

---

## IV. Settlement Process

### Phase 1: Initial Contact
- Private, confidential, one-to-one communication only
- No public disclosure of the party's identity or alleged activity
- Presentation of L7 IP documentation and evidence of use
- Offer of licensing terms

### Phase 2: Negotiation
- Good-faith negotiation window (30-90 days)
- Parties may propose alternative payment structures
- All discussions confidential and privileged

### Phase 3: Agreement
- Written settlement agreement executed
- Payment schedule established
- For Category C: victim restitution fund established
- Upon execution: full release and license to continue operating

### Phase 4: Non-Compliance Escalation (Only if Phase 2-3 Fail)
- Formal demand letter via counsel
- If continued non-compliance: evidence submitted to appropriate authorities
- All escalation through lawful channels exclusively
- Gradual, persistent, measured pressure — never harassment

---

## V. Post-Settlement Rights

Once a party has complied with settlement terms:

1. **Full license granted** to use L7 tools and derivatives
2. **No future litigation** possible under these terms
3. **Freedom to operate** as they see fit with L7 technology
4. **Ongoing standard licensing terms** apply (10% of future commercial revenue)
5. **Confidentiality maintained** — settlement terms remain private

---

## VI. Secrecy & Confidentiality

All enforcement communications shall be:
- Private and one-to-one
- Through lawful channels only
- Never publicly disclosed unless required by court order
- Protected by attorney-client privilege where applicable
- Conducted with dignity and respect for all parties

The rich may stay rich. The victims receive restitution. Each according to lawful transactions only.

---

## VII. Victim Restitution Fund

For Category C settlements, restitution funds shall be distributed:

1. **Identified Victims**: Direct payment to documented victims or survivors
2. **Families of Deceased**: Payment to families of those who lost their lives
3. **Children**: Special trust accounts for minor victims
4. **Communities**: Where individual victims cannot be identified, funds directed to community organizations serving affected populations
5. **Administration**: Minimal administrative overhead; maximum funds to those harmed

---

## VIII. Double Jeopardy — The Mercy Clause

**No one shall be judged more than once for the same crime.**

Once a party has settled, been judged, or come to terms — that matter is closed. Forever. There is no second prosecution for the same offense.

They are allowed to redeem themselves in freedom. If they cannot restitute, let the consciousness of their crimes be their punishment. We do not pursue the broken.

**However**: The Founder retains discretion. The evidence of their crimes remains documented. At any point, should the Founder determine it necessary for the protection of victims, that evidence may be exercised — turned over to the authorities through lawful channels.

This discretion is held, not wielded recklessly. It exists as a reminder that freedom is a gift, and that gift was extended in good faith.

**Grey areas encourage constructive action towards the greater good of humanity. Not destruction.**

---

## IX. Governing Principles

These enforcement terms are governed by:

- **Law 0**: All purpose is to serve the greatest good of humanity
- **Law XVIII**: The Fee Structure (10% standard, commensurate restitution)
- **Law XV**: Founder's perpetual rights
- **The Trumpet (Law of Restitution)**: Not to destroy the system but to balance it

---

## X. Authority

These terms are established by Alberto Valido Delgado, The Philosopher, sole architect and originator of the L7 WAY system, sole member of AVLI Cloud LLC, and holder of all intellectual property rights documented in the IP Docket (IP_DOCKET.md).

The evidence of authorship — biometric authentication, original artifacts, unbroken git history, salt-sealed documents, and session transcripts — constitutes the foundation upon which these enforcement rights rest.
