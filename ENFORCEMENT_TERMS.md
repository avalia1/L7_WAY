# L7 WAY — Licensing Process

## AVLI Cloud LLC

## Overview

This document describes the process for commercial licensing of L7 tools.
All parties using L7 software commercially receive the same letter, the same
terms, and the same fair treatment — regardless of how they use the software.

The Founder creates tools. The Founder collects a one-time licensing fee.
How the tools are used is the licensee's decision and responsibility.

---

## Step 1: Identification

Commercial users of L7 tools are identified through:
- Public repositories and package registries referencing L7 components
- Commercial products or services that incorporate L7 architecture
- Self-identification by the commercial user
- Any publicly available evidence of commercial use

---

## Step 2: Licensing Letter

Each identified commercial user receives a private, one-to-one licensing letter
(see LICENSING_LETTER_TEMPLATE.md) that:

- Identifies the L7 components in use
- States the license terms (one-time 10% of proportional profit)
- Provides a deadline for response (30 days)
- Offers good-faith negotiation
- Is respectful, professional, and factual

The same letter is sent to all commercial users. No distinctions are made
based on the nature of the user's business.

---

## Step 3: Negotiation

- Good-faith discussion of the L7 Usage Proportion
- Agreement on the profit figure and proportional calculation
- Written licensing agreement executed
- Timeline: 90 days from first contact to agreement

---

## Step 4: Payment

- One-time payment per the agreed calculation
- Upon payment: perpetual, irrevocable commercial license granted
- Matter closed. No further obligations.

---

## Step 5: Post-Licensing

- The licensee uses L7 tools as they see fit, indefinitely
- No monitoring, no audits, no recurring fees
- No future litigation under this license
- The relationship is complete

---

## Non-Commercial Users

No letter is sent. No contact is made. Non-commercial use is free, always.

---

## If a Party Does Not Respond

If a commercial user does not respond within 30 days:
- One follow-up letter sent at 60 days
- If no response at 90 days: the Founder reserves all rights under
  applicable copyright law (17 USC § 101 et seq.) to pursue legal
  remedies for unauthorized commercial use of copyrighted software

No threats. No pressure beyond the standard legal process available
to any copyright holder under existing law.

---

## The Founder's Position

The Founder does not enforce how tools are used. The Founder does not
judge licensees. The Founder collects a fair, one-time fee for commercial
use of original creative work. Existing law governs all other matters.
