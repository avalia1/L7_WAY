record_id: inception
birth_date: 2026-01-12
owner: L7_WAY
status: active
lineage: initial_concept

summary:
  - Established L7_WAY as the common language and gateway doctrine.
  - Defined L7 types, schemas, enforcement, and type boundary.
  - Created citizens filesystem (.l7), UI filesystem (.emp), and legion format (.lg).
  - Built Empire UI with catalog, legion map, graph, sidecar, and command input.
  - Added governance: doctrine, law, apprentice, transformer, lifecycle, manifesto.

key_decisions:
  - Gateway is universal entry point; tools are accessed via gateway only.
  - L7 are types (not emojis); entity type is absolute and outside L7.
  - Registry is propagated by gateway; provinces do not need change notices.
  - Entities must register birth date, owner, lineage, status, and L7.
  - Uniqueness prevents duplication; entities should be small and composable.
  - Marching orders are non-composable mission logic.
  - Node network is gateway intelligence for clustering tools.
  - Legions propose; humans approve. Execution requires explicit UI confirmation.
  - Restraint is strength; only what serves the empire enters.

artifacts_created:
  - L7_WAY docs: ARCHITECTURE.md, BOOK_OF_LAW.md, ENFORCEMENT.md, TOOL_REGISTRY.md
  - L7 schemas: L7_SCHEMA.json, REGISTRY_SCHEMA.json
  - Entity registry system: ENTITY_REGISTRY.md, ENTITY_REGISTRY.json, ENTITY_TEMPLATE.md
  - Lifecycle and lore: PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md, HERO_JOURNEY.md, APPRENTICE_PROTOCOL.md
  - Intelligence and onboarding: RAG_INTELLIGENCE.md, TRANSFORMER.md
  - CLI spec: L7_CLI_SPEC.md
  - Empire UI: empire/ with server and web UI
  - Citizens filesystem: ~/.l7 with template, email.l7, and tool citizens
  - UI filesystem: ~/.emp with EmpireUI.emp launcher and template
  - Legion template: ~/.l7/legion.lg
  - Manifesto: MANIFESTO.md

conversation_record:
  - Defined empire metaphor: gateway as road, L7 as lingua, citizens/legions as structure.
  - Formalized doctrine, laws, restraint, and type boundary.
  - Implemented Empire UI interactions: force-directed L7 nodes, legion map, sidecar.
  - Added wikilinks for composability and semantic relations.
  - Onboarded MCP tools into .l7 citizens from services-registry.

notes:
  - Keep origin records updated for key decisions and milestones.
  - Maintain coherence between local L7_WAY and GitHub.
