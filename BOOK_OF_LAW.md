# Book of the Law (Rules of Empire)

## Law I — The Gateway
All tool access flows through the gateway. No exceptions.

## Law II — The Lingua
Every entity declares L7 with emoji markers. If it cannot be translated, it cannot enter.

## Law III — The Registry
Every entity is registered with birth date, owner, lineage, status, and L7 declaration.

## Law IV — The Adapter
All clients use adapters. UI never calls tools directly.

## Law V — The Result
Every tool returns normalized results: `{ data, error, meta }`.

## Law VI — The Propagation
The registry is propagated by the gateway. Provinces do not need change notices.

## Law VII — The Composition
Units are small and composable. New entities are formed by citizen groups.

## Law VIII — The Orders
Marching orders are non-composable mission logic and constraints.

## Law IX — The Sacred Work
Work and space are sacred; duplication is forbidden by design.
