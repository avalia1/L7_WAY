# Book of the Law (Rules of Empire)

## Law I — The Gateway
All tool access flows through the gateway. No exceptions.

## Law II — The Lingua
Every entity declares L7 as types. If it cannot be translated, it cannot enter.

## Law III — The Registry
Every entity is registered with birth date, owner, lineage, status, and L7 declaration.

## Law IV — The Adapter
All clients use adapters. UI never calls tools directly.

## Law V — The Result
Every tool returns normalized results: `{ data, error, meta }`.

## Law VI — The Propagation
The registry is propagated by the gateway. Provinces do not need change notices.

## Law VII — The Composition
Units are small and composable. New entities are formed by citizen groups.

## Law VIII — The Orders
Marching orders are non-composable mission logic and constraints.

## Law IX — The Sacred Work
Work and space are sacred; duplication is forbidden by design.

## Law X — The Human Hand
Legions propose; humans approve. No execution without explicit UI confirmation.

## Law XI — The Absolute Type
Type is absolute and singular. There is no “type of type.” Type governs empire, legion, citizen, and L7.

## Law XII — The Principle of Restraint
Only what serves the empire enters. Restraint is strength: build the minimum that preserves order and enables growth.

## Law XIII — The Socratic Sequence
Timing is the third principle. The engine of movement is: 1) Think, 2) Ask, 3) Answer, 4) Refine. This sequence organizes legions and their execution.

## Law XIV — The Spiral (Rebirth)
Completion restarts the cycle at a higher level. 4 becomes 1, and 13 opens the next sequence. In the system, this is versioning: endings become beginnings.
