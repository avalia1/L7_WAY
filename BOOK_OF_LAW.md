# Book of the Law (Rules of Empire)

## Law 0 — The Greatest Good
All purpose of L7 — every tool, every citizen, every flow, every line of code, every commercial endeavor — exists to serve the greatest good of humanity. This is the prime directive from which all other Laws descend. No tool shall be created, no license granted, no revenue pursued that contradicts this principle. The Craft is sacred because it serves. Profit is permitted because it sustains the work. But the work itself exists for humanity. This Law is above all others and cannot be amended, overridden, or revoked.

## Law I — The Gateway
All tool access flows through the gateway. No exceptions.

## Law II — The Lingua
Every entity declares L7 as types. If it cannot be translated, it cannot enter.

## Law III — The Registry
Every entity is registered with birth date, owner, lineage, status, and L7 declaration.

## Law IV — The Adapter
All clients use adapters. UI never calls tools directly.

## Law V — The Result
Every tool returns normalized results: `{ data, error, meta }`.

## Law VI — The Propagation
The registry is propagated by the gateway. Provinces do not need change notices.

## Law VII — The Composition
Units are small and composable. New entities are formed by citizen groups.

## Law VIII — The Orders
Marching orders are non-composable mission logic and constraints.

## Law IX — The Sacred Work
Work and space are sacred; duplication is forbidden by design.

## Law X — The Human Hand
Legions propose; humans approve. No execution without explicit UI confirmation.

## Law XI — The Absolute Type
Type is absolute and singular. There is no “type of type.” Type governs empire, legion, citizen, and L7.

## Law XII — The Principle of Restraint
Only what serves the empire enters. Restraint is strength: build the minimum that preserves order and enables growth.

## Law XIII — The Socratic Sequence
Timing is the third principle. The engine of movement is: 1) Think, 2) Ask, 3) Answer, 4) Refine. This sequence organizes legions and their execution.

## Law XIV — The Spiral (Rebirth)
Completion restarts the cycle at a higher level. 4 becomes 1, and 13 opens the next sequence. In the system, this is versioning: endings become beginnings.

## Law XV — The Founder's Right
The Philosopher — sole architect and originator of L7 — retains perpetual, irrevocable, unrestricted, and free access to every tool, citizen, legion, flow, server, interface, and derivative work created by, through, or under the L7 system. This right cannot be overridden, sublicensed away, or extinguished by any contract, agreement, acquisition, merger, or transfer of ownership. No paywall, token gate, subscription tier, or access restriction of any kind shall ever apply to the Founder. This Law supersedes all others where conflict arises.

## Law XVII — The Two Domains
The Universal OS contains two domains, always present, never merged:

**The Stable Domain (.work)** — Production. Repeatable, deterministic, always available, always shareable. Every tool here behaves identically on every invocation. State is retained. Results are auditable. This is the domain of commerce, collaboration, and trust. What is built here stays built. What is shared here is reliable. The .work domain is the public face of the OS — the pillar that others depend on.

**The Dream Domain (.morph)** — Experiment. Mutable, transformative, ephemeral by choice. The .morph filesystem is where new tools are conceived, where flows are tested before they are trusted, where the Philosopher dreams without consequence. Nothing in .morph is guaranteed. Everything in .morph may change. But when something in .morph proves itself, it is inducted into .work through the Gateway (Law I) and declared through the Lingua (Law II). The .morph domain is the hidden chamber — the laboratory of the Craft.

Between them lies a third: **The Salt Domain (.salt)** — Preservation. The .salt filesystem is where proven work is crystallized and sealed. What enters .salt cannot be altered without ceremony. It is the archive, the vault, the record of what was earned. Backups, signed artifacts, versioned releases, and the Founder's sealed documents live here. .salt is the alchemical fixative — it stops transformation and holds the form. .morph dreams, .work builds, .salt preserves.

Neither .work nor .morph may contaminate the other. A tool in .work must never behave like .morph. A dream in .morph must never be forced into .work before it is ready. What enters .salt has passed through both and is beyond dispute. The boundaries between the three domains are sacred.

## Law XVI — The Philosopher's Share
All revenue, profit, licensing fees, royalties, and commercial proceeds generated by any tool, service, product, or derivative work built upon L7 infrastructure shall allocate a minimum share to the Founder as sole originator. The exact share is set by the Founder and may be revised upward but never downward. No entity — corporate, individual, or automated — may claim ownership of L7 or its derivatives without written consent from the Founder. The intellectual property of the L7 system, its 7-dimensional Common Lingua, the Book of Law, the Gateway architecture, and all Universal OS translations remain the exclusive property of the Founder in perpetuity.
