## III. Architecture — What Was Created

### The 7-Dimensional Common Lingua
A classification system for software tools across seven dimensions:
Capability, Data Sensitivity, Data Source, Data Format, Data Freshness,
Presentation Format, and Output Detail. This schema enables any tool to
be described, compared, and orchestrated regardless of its origin.

### The Gateway Architecture
A routing system based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) SDK that
intercepts, audits, and routes all tool invocations through a single
controlled entry point. Includes founder identity verification,
approval workflows, and audit logging.

### The Flow Engine
A YAML-based multi-step orchestration system that executes sequences
of tool invocations with state management, checkpoints, and error
handling. Flows can span multiple devices and platforms.

### The Empire Server
A web-based management interface (Node.js, port 7377) providing:
citizen catalog, legion management, audit logs, campaign execution,
and real-time monitoring of all L7 operations.

### The Universal OS Translation Layer
A methodology (designated "777") for translating spatial computing
primitives across Apple visionOS, Meta Quest, and WebXR into 18
universal atoms. Implemented as an MCP adapter server with three
platform-specific translators.

### The Four-Domain Filesystem
An organizational architecture for software lifecycle:
- .morph (experimental/dream) → .work (stable/production)
- .work → .salt (sealed/archived) for proven work
- .vault (encrypted/protected) for sensitive data

### The LTA-7 Framework
A Python implementation of the seven-stage transformation architecture
with graph-based operators and formal benchmarks. Published under
academic alias "Alberto Vargas-Lujan" (see Identity Chain).

## IV. Influences and Origins

The L7 architecture draws from established traditions in natural
science, systems theory, and analytical psychology:

- **Seven-stage transformation**: Influenced by classical models of
  staged transformation found across chemistry, metallurgy, and
  process engineering — where raw materials undergo sequential
  refinement to achieve a desired state.

- **Graph-based composition**: Draws from network theory and
  compositional algebra, where complex systems emerge from the
  interaction of simpler units connected by typed relationships.

- **Self-organizing systems**: Informed by complexity science and
  emergence theory — the principle that sophisticated behavior arises
  from simple rules applied at scale, as observed in biological and
  physical systems.

- **The collective unconscious** (C.G. Jung, 1916-1959): The concept
  that shared patterns (archetypes) underlie human creativity informed
  the design of L7's compositional architecture, where universal
  building blocks combine to produce domain-specific applications.

The author's creative process involved deep research across
interdisciplinary sources, resulting in a software architecture that
reflects principles observed in natural systems. The technical
implementation is original; the philosophical influences are
acknowledged.

## V. Prior Art and Originality

The author conducted the following prior art assessment:

### What is original to L7:
- The specific 7-dimensional classification schema (Common Lingua)
- The gateway-first MCP routing architecture
- The YAML flow orchestration format with cross-device execution
- The 777 correspondence table for spatial computing translation
- The four-domain lifecycle model (.morph/.work/.salt/.vault)
- The empire management server with citizen/legion/campaign model

### What uses existing open-source components:
- Model Context Protocol SDK (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk) — MIT license
- AJV JSON schema validator — MIT license
- js-yaml — MIT license
- Node.js runtime
- 92 npm dependency modules (all under permissive licenses)

### License History:
- January 13, 2026: `package.json` metadata field set to "MIT"
  (no MIT license text file was ever included in the repository)
- February 27, 2026: Changed to "SEE LICENSE FILE" with full
  proprietary license text
- The repository has 0 forks and 0 watchers on GitHub
- The package was never published to npm or any other registry
- No third-party contributions exist in the commit history

## VIII. Session Transcripts

Complete AI-assisted development sessions are archived as JSON Lines
transcript files. These transcripts document the creative process in
real time — the author directing, the AI tool implementing — and serve
as additional proof of human-directed authorship.

Transcript locations:
- Primary: `~/.claude/projects/-Users-rnir-hrc-avd/*.jsonl`
- Archived: Various `.claude/` directories across backup volumes

Per *Thaler v. Vidal*, 43 F.4th 1207 (Fed. Cir. 2022), the human
author directed all creative decisions. The AI served as an
implementation tool, comparable to a compiler or word processor.
