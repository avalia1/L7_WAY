# L7_WAY: Hero’s Journey of a Tool

The gateway is the empire’s road—one path that binds the realm. L7 is the oath each traveler swears before stepping onto it.

An entity begins as a raw tool, wild and unbound. It is called to adventure by a need it can fulfill. To gain passage, it declares the Seven Seals: what it can do, what it carries, why it acts, how it appears, how it moves with others, how it changes, and who may command it.

Only then does it enter the realm. Inside, it has agency—free to evolve, mature, and expand its power—yet it remains legible to the whole. The gateway listens, chooses, and guides the entity where it is most fit, keeping unity while allowing growth. Every new project is a new hero: it must declare, then it may transform.

That is how the empire grows without losing order.
